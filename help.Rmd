## How to use:
Dates must be in the form: YYYY-MM-DD, this can be easily done in except by selected the start and end columns and formatting as date (YYYY-MM-DD).
If you want to group the data then use the group column accordingly.
To add differing colours to  your gantt by default the options you need to specify in className are: 
*blank*: red for points, *Write_up*: orange, *Analysis*:grey, *Planning*:cyan, *Research*: green, of course you can download the code from GitHub and edit the style section to fully customise the colour scheme to your desire.getwd(0)
Everything is **case SenSiTIve**
Content is what you want to display as text on the gantt chart for that object
type is what you want to appear on the gantt chart (point, background , range)
subgroup can be used to order the grouping inside of each group if required.
